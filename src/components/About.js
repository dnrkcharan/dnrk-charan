        <p>
          Hi, I'm Dasari Narada Rama Krishna Charan, a passionate and creative developer.
          I have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, with a focus
          on building modern and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in web development started with 2 years of experience.
          I love turning ideas into reality through coding and enjoy staying updated with the
          latest technologies in the ever-evolving tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on side projects,
          and enjoying quality time with friends and family. I believe in continuous learning
          and am always eager to take on new challenges.
        </p>
